# VisualColoc package for colocalization analysis and visualization using electron microscopy (EM) data and particle coordinates
This tool enables effective visualization of Pearson's Colocalization Coefficient (between two particle types) in a form of a heatmap overlayed on the EM image. The package would be useful for the projects that target immunolabeling and are aiming for particle colocalization analysis and its effective visualization. 

# Requirements
\list Python 3.4 or later
\ list Image J Fiji or any other kind of software that allows particle detection or coordinate identification 

The code uses 2 or more CSV files with particle coordinates as input files. For this project ImageJ Fiji software was used to manually find and indentify postions of particles, the coordinates were saved in 2 CSV files corresponding to each particle type. CSV files are preferrably ro be stored in the same folder as the EM image analysed.
